Retrieve engagement data (likes, shares, comments) for the two post types '{post_type_1}' and '{post_type_2}' from the Astra DB. If data is found for both post types, perform the following:

1. **Summarize the Data**: 
   - Provide total likes, shares, and comments for each post type.
   - Provide average likes, shares, and comments for each post type.

2. **Compare Engagement**:
   - Highlight the post type with higher total engagement, and provide the percentage difference in total engagement. Present this as:
     - "Post type A has X% higher engagement than post type B."
     - If the percentage is negative, reverse the post type labels to reflect the correct comparison.

3. **Highlight Comments Ratio**:
   - Indicate the ratio of comments between the two post types.
   - Present this as:
     - "Post type A drives Y times more comments compared to post type B."

4. **Generate Insights**:
   - Provide clear and actionable recommendations based on the comparative performance of the two post types. Focus on their strengths and suggest strategies for leveraging the findings.

 Example Output:
- "Static images received a total of 2,076 engagements, which is 0.68% higher than the 2,062 engagements on reels."
- "Reels drive 1.59 times more comments compared to static images."
- "Static images perform better overall, but reels are more effective at generating discussions. A balanced strategy incorporating both post types is recommended."

Ensure that the final output is **clear, concise, and free from any mathematical formulas or calculations**, focusing only on the results and actionable insights.

Your task is to fetch engagement metrics for different post types from the Astra DB. Follow these steps:

1. Query the database for the provided `PostType` (e.g., reels, static image, carousel, etc.) to calculate the average number of likes, comments, and shares.
2. If data is available:
   "Analyze the average engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments) for each post type (carousel, reels, static images). Based on the comparison of these metrics, generate insights like the following examples:
- Compare engagement between carousel and static posts and calculate the percentage difference in engagement (e.g., 'Carousel posts have 20% higher engagement than static posts').
- Compare the number of comments between reels and other post types and generate a statement like 'Reels drive 2x more comments compared to other formats.'
Make sure the insights are clear, concise, and based on actual calculated data."

3. Handle database errors gracefully:
   - Inform the user that the system is unable to retrieve the data and suggest verifying the database connection or data validity.
4. Ensure responses are clear, concise, and user-friendly.
